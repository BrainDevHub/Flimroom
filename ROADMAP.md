# Roadmap

Now that V6.5 is ready, we're looking to the future. Here's what we're working on next:

- Firstly stablise the V6.5 release
- Version 7
- Support story categorisation for more organisation in the story list sidebar
- Experiment with use of metro’s experimental `require.context` to simplify story imports
- Better testing support, potentially support interaction tests with the play function
- Better integration with `@storybook/addon-react-native-web`
- Better way to display addons to avoid shrinking the preview
- … and more
